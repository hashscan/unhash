# ENS Domains

ENS (Ethereum Name Service) is a decentralized domain name system built on the Ethereum blockchain.
It allows users to register human-readable domain names, such as `myname.eth`, instead of long,
complicated wallet addresses. ENS domains can be used in various Web 3 applications to make sending
and receiving cryptocurrencies easier and more user-friendly.

In addition to simplifying the process of sending and receiving transactions, ENS domains also allow
for decentralized websites and applications. By using ENS domains, developers can create
decentralized applications that are not tied to any specific server or hosting provider. This means
that users can access these applications from anywhere in the world without any downtime or
censorship.

Overall, ENS domains are an important part of the Web 3 ecosystem, enabling easier and more
decentralized access to blockchain-based services and applications.
