# NFTs

In addition to domain names, ENS also supports the creation and transfer of NFTs (non-fungible
tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain. NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent anything from
artwork to virtual real estate. By using ENS domains, creators can associate their NFTs with a
human-readable name, making it easier for users to discover and interact with them. This can help to
increase the visibility and value of NFTs, and further drive adoption of the Web 3 ecosystem.

To create and transfer NFTs on the Ethereum network, users will need to use a smart contract that
conforms to the ERC-721 standard. This standard defines a set of functions and events that allow for
the creation, transfer, and ownership of unique, non-fungible tokens. Once an NFT has been created
and associated with an ENS domain, it can be bought, sold, and traded on various NFT marketplaces
and platforms.

Overall, the integration of NFTs with ENS domains provides a powerful tool for creators and users
alike, enabling the creation and distribution of unique digital assets in a decentralized and secure
manner.
